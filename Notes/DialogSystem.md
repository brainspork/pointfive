# Dialog system

## Things needed
- Interaction interface
- Widget blue print (UI)
- AI controller
- Behavior tree, behavior tree tasks, and black board
  - Behavior trees are decision trees for NPCs
  - Behavior tree tasks are code blocks that run in tree
  - Black board holds on to info behavior trees need


## Remember
- Implement interfaces from class settigns menu
- Behavior trees execution order is top down ltr
- The eye next to a variable makes it editiable on each BP instance
- Variable expose on spawn will give it a pin when used in a BP
- Widgets
  - Visiblility visible is clickable
  - Visiblitiy Not Hit - Testable (self) is visible but no clickable
- IS FOCUSABLE == TRUE ON WIDGET BASE OBJ
